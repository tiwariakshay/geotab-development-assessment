As part of your application to FleetCarma, we ask that you complete the following challenge. 

### Task 1 - Fix some ugly code ###

Imagine yourself working at Joke Company™. This company has an app that gets random Chuck Norris jokes and can substitute other peoples names into the joke instead of Chuck Norris'.

Your task as a professional developer is to clean up this app and make it something you can be proud of.

*Note: This is NOT a representation of our codebase to be clear. We did have fun crafting this beauty however ;)*

### Task 2 - Write a report ###

Write a document explaining some of the improvements you made to the code, and why you did so.

### What do I need? ###

* [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) - any platform
